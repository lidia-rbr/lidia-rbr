## About
I specialize in building automation tools and internal applications using **Google Apps Script** and **Google Cloud**.  
Most of my work is client-based and private, but I progressively publish reusable tools, libraries, and experiments.

I also write technical tutorials and long-form content focused on real-world Apps Script use cases.
